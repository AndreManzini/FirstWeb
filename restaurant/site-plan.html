        Who is Chef Andre Mori?
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in Araraquara Brasil, not far from Venice. My family is a mix of Italian and Brazilian people. From a very young age, I had the chance to learn about the two different kinds of cuisine that come from these areas, and I also learned about the ingredients and ways of cooking from both regions.

        I have always had a passion for cooking. I remember trying to help my mother in the kitchen when I was very young.

        I attended a college in the city of Sao Paulo where I got a degree specializing in Italian cuisine.

        I like cooking everything, and I always treat the ingredients I use with a lot of respect. For me, the most important thing is making my customers happy.
