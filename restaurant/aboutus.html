                    Italian-American cuisine is a style of Italian cuisine adapted 
                    throughout the United States. Italian-American food has been 
                    shaped throughout history by various waves of immigrants and 
                    their descendants, called Italian Americans. As immigrants from
                    the different regions of Italy settled throughout the various 
                    regions of the United States, many brought with them a distinct
                    regional Italian culinary tradition. Many of these foods and 
                    recipes developed into new favorites for the townspeople and 
                    later for Americans nationwide.

                    I grew up in Araraquara Brasil, not far from Venice. My family is 
                    a mix of Italian and Brazilian people. From a very young age, 
                    I had the chance to learn about the two different kinds of cuisine 
                    that come from these areas, and I also learned about the ingredients 
                    and ways of cooking from both regions. I have always had a passion 
                    for cooking. I remember trying to help my mother in the kitchen 
                    when I was very young. I attended a college in the city of Sao Paulo 
                    where I got a degree specializing in Italian cuisine. I like 
                    cooking everything, and I always treat the ingredients I use with a 
                    lot of respect. For me, the most important thing is making
