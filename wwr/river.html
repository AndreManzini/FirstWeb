                    ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                    number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged
                    beauty of the river that they never left. </h5>

                    late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like
                    to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</h2>
